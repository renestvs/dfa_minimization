This is libD 1.1.

libD is a set of javascript functions and objects under the GNU GPL 3+ that can be used in various projects.

You can see libD as a chunk of common code shared between several projects.
It's not yet mature. You can use it, but at your own risk:
it's not yet well documented, its API can change (but the base should not change very much for this version), it can eat your users.

If after reading this you still want to use it, ok then.
I would appreciate you send me a message to let me know.

Any contribution, suggestion, idea, code will be appreciated.

Internet Explorer is differently supported by the different modules because little efforts are made to support this browser.
Almost everything should work on IE7+  anyway.

For those who are interested, the "D" of libD has no meaning.
I just had to choose a namespace and libD is what came. Why? I don't know. Maybe "Dirty" could fit well for the moment.

libD calls third-party shims available in the 3rd folder. See 3rd/README for more details.
